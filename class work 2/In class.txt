Part 1:
-- Given the Ships and the Subs tables (see 090121.sql below), create the SQL to answer the following. Show the SQL and results and answer the related rows/column questions. 

-- 1 Do an implicit join on ships and subs (i.e., using WHERE) How many columns and how many rows are in your answer?

-- 2 Do an explicit inner join on ships and subs (i.e., using ON) How many columns and how many rows are in your answer?

-- 3 Do a natural join on ships and subs How many columns and how many rows are in your answer? Why are the number of columns different than in 1 and 2 above? If you do not know, the answer can be found in my lectures and in the text.

-- 4 Do an inner join on ships and subs USING(SUB_ID) How many columns and how many rows are in your answer? Why are the number of columns different than in 1 and 2 above? If you do not know, the answer can be found in my lectures and in the text.


Part 2: 

-- Given the Bears and the Cubs tables, answer the following:

1. Find the cities that the teams have in common. List each city only one time in the results.

2. Find all the cities the Cubs played in and the matching the cities that the Bears played in.

3. Find the dates and cities when the Cubs and Bears played on the same day and in the same city -- use ON. How many columns and how many rows are in your answer?

4. Redo #3 -- use USING. How many columns and how many rows are in your answer? Why are the number of columns different than in 3 above?

5. Redo #3 -- use a NATURAL JOIN How many columns and how many rows are in your answer? Why are the number of columns different than in 3 above?
